X4 Customizer 1.24.10
-----------------

This tool offers a framework for modding the X4 and extension game files programmatically, guided by user selected plugins (analyses, transforms, utilities). Features include:

  * GUI to improve accessibility, designed using Qt.
  * Integrated catalog read/write support.
  * XML diff patch read/write support.
  * Automatic detection and loading of enabled extensions.
  * Three layer design: framework, plugins, and control script.
  * Framework handles the file system, plugin management, etc.
  * Plugins include analysis, transforms, and utilities.
  * Plugins operate on a user's unique mixture of mods, and can easily be rerun after game patches or mod updates.
  * Transforms can dynamically read and alter game files, instead of being limited to static changes like standard extensions.
  * Transforms are parameterized, to adjust their behavior.
  * Analyses can generate customized documentation.
  * Transformed files are written to a new or specified X4 extension.
  * Utilities offer extension error checking and cat pack/unpack support.

This tool is available as runnable Python source code (tested on 3.7 with the lxml and PyQt5 packages) or as a compiled executable for 64-bit Windows.


Running the compiled release:

  * "Start_Gui.bat"
    - This starts up the Customizer GUI.
    - Equivelent to running "bin/X4_Customizer.exe"
  * "Run_Script.bat [script_name] [args]"
    - This runs a script directly without loading the GUI.
    - Call from the command line for full options (-h for help), or run directly to execute the default script at "Scripts/Default_Script.py".
    - Script name may be given without a .py extension, and without a path if it is in the Scripts folder.
  * "Clean_Script.bat [script_name] [args]"
    - Removes files generated in a prior run of the given or default control script.
  * "Check_Extensions.bat [args]"
    - Runs a command line script which will test extensions for errors, focusing on diff patching and dependency checks.
  * "Cat_Unpack.bat [args]"
    - Runs a command line script which unpacks catalog files.
  * "Cat_Pack.bat [args]"
    - Runs a command line script which packs catalog files.

Running the Python source code:

  * "python Framework\Main.py [script_name] [args]"
    - This is the primary entry function for the python source code, and equivalent to X4_Customizer.exe.
    - When no script is given, this launches the GUI.


GUI sections:

  * "Script" displays the current control script, alongside documentation on available plugins.  Drag plugins to the script window for a fast templated copy.  Scripts can be opened or saved, and default to the Scripts folder.  Syntax is highlighted as Python code. Press "Run Script" to run the current script; other tabs displaying game information will be updated automatically with the script changes.

  * "Config" allows customization of settings. These are saved to a json file in the main tool directory when the window closes.

  * The "Edit" menu opens up tabs with editable tables of game object information. Objects may be displayed individually or in a table. See further below for details. All edits made are saved in a json file in the main tool directory when a script is run or the window closes.

  * The "Utilities" menu currently has one option, the Virtual File System. This shows which game files the Customizer has loaded, patched from other extensions (blue), or modified itself (red). Right click a file for the option to view its contents.

  * The File Viewer tabs display individual file contents, in their pre-diff patch, post-diff patch, and post-customizer versions. Select two versions and press "Compare" to get a summary on lines changed. Press "Reload" to force the file to be reloaded from disk, including any diff patches; this may be used to test customize diff patch files in another extension.

The control script:

  * This tool is primarily controlled by a user supplied python script which will specify the desired plugins to run. Generally this acts as a build script to create a custom extension.

  * The key control script sections are:
    - "from Plugins import *" to make all major functions available.
    - Optionally call Settings() to change paths and set non-default options; this can also be done through a setttings.json file or through the GUI.
    - Call a series of plugins with desired input parameters; see plugin documentation for available options.
    - Call Write_Extension() to write out any modified files, formatted as diff patches.
    
  * Scripts of varying complexity are available in the Scripts folder, and may act as examples.
    

GUI based object editing:

  * In addition to script selected transforms, game information can be directly edited for select objects on the appropriate edit tabs. Tabs include "weapons", "wares", and others as time goes on.

  * Press "Refresh" on the tab to load the game information.
  * The "vanilla" column shows the object field values for the base version of the game files loaded.
  * The "patched" column shows field values after other extensions have had their diff patches applied.
  * The "edited" column is where you may change values manually.
  * Running a script that includes the Apply_Live_Editor_Patches plugin will apply edits to the game files.
  * The "current" column will show the post-script field values, and mainly exists for verification of hand edits as well as other transform changes.


Writing custom edit code:

  * This framework may be used to write custom file editing routines.
  * The general steps are: use Load_File() to obtain the patched file contents, use Get_Root() to obtain the current file root xml (which includes any prior transform changes), make any custom edits with the help of the lxml package, and to put the changes back using Update_Root().
  * Existing plugins offer examples of this approach.
  * Edits made using the framework will automatically support diff patch generation.
  * Non-xml file support is more rudimentary, operating on file binary data pending further support for specific formats.
  * Routines may be written as plugin functions and put up for inclusion in later Customizer releases to share with other users.

* Settings:


    This holds general settings and paths to control the customizer. Adjust these settings as needed prior to running the first plugin, using direct writes to attributes.
    
    Settings may be updated individually, or as arguments of a call to Settings, or through a "settings.json" file in the top X4 Customizer folder (eg. where documentation resides). Any json settings will overwrite defaults, and be overwritten by settings in the control script. Changes made using the GUI will be applied to the json settings.
    
    Examples:
    * In the control script (prefix paths with 'r' to support backslashes):
    
          Settings.path_to_x4_folder   = r'C:\...'
          Settings.path_to_user_folder = r'C:\...'
          Settings(
               path_to_x4_folder   = r'C:\...',
               path_to_user_folder = r'C:\...'
               )
    
    * In settings.json (sets defaults for all scripts):
    
          {
            "path_to_x4_folder"        : "C:\...",
            "path_to_user_folder"      : "C:\...",
            "output_to_user_extensions": "true"
          }
    
    
    Paths:
    * path_to_x4_folder
      - Path to the main x4 folder.
      - Defaults to HOMEDRIVE/"Steam/steamapps/common/X4 Foundations"
    * path_to_user_folder
      - Path to the folder where user files are located.
      - Should include config.xml, content.xml, etc.
      - Defaults to HOMEPATH/"Documents/Egosoft/X4" or a subfolder with an 8-digit name.
    * path_to_source_folder
      - Optional path to a source folder that holds high priority source files, which will be used instead of reading the x4 cat/dat files.
      - For use when running plugins on manually edited files.
      - Not needed in general use.
      - All files from the source folder will be copied into the extension.
      - Defaults to None
    * allow_path_error
      - Bool, if True and the x4 or user folder path looks wrong, the customizer will still attempt to run (with a warning).
      - Defaults to False
          
    Input:
    * prefer_single_files
      - Bool, if True then loose files will be used before those in cat/dat files, otherwise cat/dat takes precedence.
      - Only applies within a single search location, eg. within an extension, within the source folder, or within the base X4 folder; a loose file in the source folder will still be used over those in the X4 folder regardless of setting.
      - Defaults to False
    * ignore_extensions
      - Bool, if True then all extensions will be ignored, and files are only sourced from the source_folder or x4_folder.
      - Defaults to False
    * extension_whitelist
      - String, optional, semicolon separated list of lowercase extension folder names to consider loading (if found and enabled).
      - If not given, all extension folders are checked, except those in the blacklist.
    * extension_blacklist
      - String, optional, semicolon separated list of lowercase extension folder names to always ignore.
    * allow_cat_md5_errors
      - Bool, if True then when files extracted from cat/dat fail to verify their md5 hash, no exception will be thrown.
      - Defaults to False; consider setting True if needing to unpack incorrectly assembled catalogs.
    * ignore_output_extension
      - Bool, if True, the target extension being generated will have its prior content ignored (this run works on the original files, and not those changes made last run).
      - Defaults to True; should only be set False if not running transforms and wanting to analyse prior output.
    * X4_exe_name
      - String, name of the X4.exe file, to be used when sourcing the file for any exe transforms (if used), assumed to be in the x4 folder.
      - Defaults to "X4.exe", but may be useful to change based on the source exe file for transforms, eg. "X4_nonsteam.exe", "X4_steam.exe", or similar.
      - Note: the modified exe is written to the x4 folder with a ".mod.exe" extension, and will not be removed on subsequent runs even if they do not select any exe editing transforms. If wanting this to work with steam, then the X4.exe may need to be replaced with this modified exe manually.
    
    Output:
    * extension_name
      - String, name of the extension being generated.
      - Spaces will be replaced with underscores for the extension id.
      - A lowercase version of this will be used for the output folder name.
      - Defaults to 'x4_customizer'
    * output_to_user_extensions
      - Bool, if True then the generated extension holding output files will be under <path_to_user_folder/extensions>.
      - Warning: any prior output on the original path will still exist, and is not cleaned out automatically at the time of this note.
      - Defaults to False, writing to <path_to_x4_folder/extensions>
    * path_to_output_folder
      - Optional, Path to the location to write the extension files to, instead of the usual X4 or user documents extensions folders.
      - This is the parent directory to the extension_name folder.
    * output_to_catalog
      - Bool, if True then the modified files will be written to a single cat/dat pair, otherwise they are written as loose files.
      - Defaults to False
    * generate_sigs
      - Bool, if True then dummy signature files will be created.
      - Defaults to True.
    * make_maximal_diffs
      - Bool, if True then generated xml diff patches will do the maximum full tree replacement instead of using the algorithm to find and patch only edited nodes.
      - Turn on to more easily view xml changes.
      - Defaults to False.
    * forced_xpath_attributes
      - String, optional comma separate list of XML node attributes which, if found when constructing xpaths for output diffs, will be included in the xpath regardless of if they are needed.
      - Example: "id,name" will always include "id" and "name" attributes of elements in the xpath.
      - Also supports child node or attributes referenced using a relative xpath. Example: "parts/part/uv_animations/uv_animation" to require a uv_animation great-great-grandchild element, or "component/@ref" to include the "ref" attribute of a "component" child.
      - Can be used to make xpaths more specific, and more likely to break if an unknown extension is applied before the output extension (eg. when the customizer output is distributed to other users).
      - Can also be used in cases where a partial xpath matches multiple nodes, to clarify a child/attribute check instead of falling back on indexing.
    * shorten_xpaths
      - Bool, if True then xpaths will be shortened using "//" syntax, at the cost of possibly matching unwanted nodes if the diff patch is applied to a modified source file.
      - Only attempts to use // for the xpath prefix currently.
      - May result in measurably longer x4 loading times if used often in large files.
    * root_file_tag
      - String, extra tag added to names of modified files in the root folder and not placed in an extension, eg. X4.exe, to avoid overwriting the originals.
      - Defaults to ".mod", eg. "X4.mod.exe".
    
    Logging:
    * live_editor_log_file_name
      - String, name a json file which the live editor (tracking hand edits in the gui) will save patches to, and reload from.
      - Patches will capture any hand edits made by the user.
      - File is located in the output extension folder.
      - Defaults to 'live_editor_log.json'
    * plugin_log_file_name

      - Defaults to 'plugin_log.txt'
    * customizer_log_file_name
      - String, name a json file to write customizer log information to, including a list of files written, information that will be loaded on the next run to guide the file handling logic.
      - File is located in the output extension folder.
      - Defaults to 'customizer_log.json'
    * log_source_paths
      - Bool, if True then the path for any source files read will be printed in the plugin log.
      - Defaults to False
    * verbose
      - Bool, if True some extra status messages may be printed to the console.
      - Defaults to True
    
    Behavior:
    * show_tab_close_button
      - Bool, if True then a gui tab close button will be shown.
    * disable_cleanup_and_writeback

      - Bool, if True all plugins will be skipped.
      - For use during cleaning mode.
      - Defaults to False
    * developer
      - Bool, if True then enable some behavior meant just for development, such as leaving exceptions uncaught.
      - Defaults to False
    * profile
      - Bool, if True then some extra profiling of customizer operations is performed, and times printed. For use during development.
      - Defaults to False.
    * disable_threading
      - Bool, if True then threads will not be used in the gui to call scripts and plugins. Will cause the gui to lock up during processing.
      - Intended for development use, to enable breakpoints during calls.
      - Defaults to False
    * use_scipy_for_scaling_equations
      - Bool, if True then scipy will be used to optimize scaling equations, for smoother curves between the boundaries.
      - If False or scipy is not found, then a simple linear scaling will be used instead.
      - May be unused currently.
      - Defaults to True
    * show_scaling_plots
      - Bool, if True and matplotlib and numpy are available, any generated scaling equations will be plotted (and their x and y vectors printed for reference). Close the plot window manually to continue plugin processing.

Analyses:

  * Print_Object_Stats

    Print out statistics for objects of a given category. This output will be similar to that viewable in the gui live editor pages, except formed into one or more tables. Produces csv and html output. Will include changes from enabled extensions.
    
    * category
      - String, category name of the objects, eg. 'weapons'.
    * file_name
      - String, name to use for generated files, without extension.
    * version
      - Optional string, version of the objects to use.

      - Defaults to "ware_stats".
    * version
      - Optional string, version of the objects to use.
        

  * Print_Weapon_Stats

    Gather up all weapon statistics, and print them out. This is a convenience wrapper around Print_Object_Stats, filling in the category and a default file name.

      - Defaults to "weapon_stats".
    * version
      - Optional string, version of the objects to use.

Adjust Transforms:

  * Common documentation

    Ship transforms will commonly use a group of matching rules to determine which ships get modified, and by how much.   
    
    * Matching rules:
      - These are tuples pairing a matching rule (string) with transform defined args, eg. ("key  value", arg0, arg1, ...).
      - The "key" specifies the xml field to look up, which will be checked for a match with "value".
      - If a target object matches multiple rules, the first match is used.
      - Supported keys for ships:
        - 'name'    : Internal name of the ship macro; supports wildcards.
        - 'purpose' : The primary role of the ship. List of purposes:
          - mine
          - trade
          - build
          - fight
        - 'type'    : The ship type. List of types:
          - courier, resupplier, transporter, freighter, miner, largeminer, builder
          - scout, interceptor, fighter, heavyfighter
          - gunboat, corvette, frigate, scavenger
          - destroyer, carrier, battleship
          - xsdrone, smalldrone, police, personalvehicle, escapepod, lasertower
        - 'class'   : The class of ship. List of classes:
          - 'ship_xs'
          - 'ship_s'
          - 'ship_m'
          - 'ship_l'
          - 'ship_xl'
          - 'spacesuit'
        - '*'       : Matches all ships; takes no value term.
    
    Examples:
    
        Adjust_Ship_Speed(1.5)
        Adjust_Ship_Speed(
            ('name ship_xen_xl_carrier_01_a*', 1.2),
            ('class ship_s'                  , 2.0),
            ('type corvette'                 , 1.5),
            ('purpose fight'                 , 1.2),
            ('*'                             , 1.1) )
    
        

  * Adjust_Ship_Crew_Capacity

    Adjusts the crew capacities of ships. Note: crewmen contributions to ship combined skill appears to adjust downward based on max capacity, so increasing capacity can lead to a ship performing worse (unverified).
    
    * match_rule_multipliers:
      - Series of matching rules paired with the multipliers to use.
        

  * Adjust_Ship_Drone_Storage

    Adjusts the drone ("unit") storage of ships.
    
    * match_rule_multipliers:
      - Series of matching rules paired with the multipliers to use.
        

  * Adjust_Ship_Hull

    Adjusts the hull values of ships.
    
    * match_rule_multipliers:
      - Series of matching rules paired with the multipliers to use.
        

  * Adjust_Ship_Missile_Storage

    Adjusts the missile storage of ships.
    
    * match_rule_multipliers:
      - Series of matching rules paired with the multipliers to use.
        

  * Adjust_Ship_Speed

    Adjusts the speed and acceleration of ships, in each direction.
    
    * match_rule_multipliers:
      - Series of matching rules paired with the multipliers to use.
        

  * Adjust_Ship_Turning

    Adjusts the turning rate of ships, in each direction.
    
    * match_rule_multipliers:
      - Series of matching rules paired with the multipliers to use.
        

  * Set_Default_Radar_Ranges

    Sets default radar ranges.  Granularity is station, type of satellite, or per ship size.  Ranges are in km, eg. 40 for vanilla game defaults of non-satellites. Note: ranges below 40km will affect when an unidentified object becomes identified, but objects will still show up out to 40km.
            
    Supported arguments:
    * ship_s
    * ship_m
    * ship_l
    * ship_xl
    * spacesuit
    * station
    * satellite
    * adv_satellite
        

  * Set_Ship_Radar_Ranges

    Sets radar ranges. Defaults are changed per object class. Note: ranges below 40km will affect when an unidentified object becomes identified, but objects will still show up out to 40km.
            
    * ship_match_rule_ranges:
      - Series of matching rules paired with the new ranges to apply for individual ships.
      - Ranges are in km.

Director Transforms:

  * Adjust_Mission_Reward_Mod_Chance

    Adjusts generic mission chance to reward a mod instead of credits. The vanilla chance is 2% for a mod, 98% for credits.
    
    Pending update for x4 3.0+.
    
    * mod_chance
      - Int, the new percent chance of rewarding a mod.
      - Should be between 0 and 100.
        

  * Adjust_Mission_Rewards

    Adjusts generic mission credit and notoriety rewards by a flat multiplier.
    
    * multiplier
      - Float, value to adjust rewards by.
    * adjust_credits
      - Bool, if True (default) changes the credit reward.
    * adjust_notoriety
      - Bool, if True (default) changes the notoriety reward.
        


***

Exe Transforms:

  * High_Precision_Systemtime

    Changes the player.systemtime property to use a higher precision underlying timer, where a printed "second" will actually have a stepping of 100 ns. Useful for performance profiling of code blocks.
    
    Underlying precision comes from Windows GetSystemTimePreciseAsFileTime, which is presumably as accurate as its 100 ns unit size.
    
    Time will roll over roughly every 7 minutes, going back to 1970, due to limitations of the underlying string format functions.
    
    For short measurements, roughly 8 ms or less, just the lower part of the timer may be used, up to hour: player.systemtime.{'%H,%M,%S'}. For longer measurements, this needs to expand into the day field and account for leap years: player.systemtime.{'%G,%j,%H,%M,%S'}.
    
    As these are strings, conversion to an actual time relies on processing outside of the normal script engine, eg. in lua. Note: 1972 was a leap year, and every 4 after, which needs to be considered for full accuracy.

Jobs Transforms:

  * Adjust_Job_Count

    Adjusts job ship counts using a multiplier, affecting all quota fields. Input is a list of matching rules, determining which jobs get adjusted.
    
    Resulting non-integer job counts are rounded, with a minimum of 1 unless the multiplier or original count were 0.
    
    * job_multipliers
      - Tuples holding the matching rules and job count multipliers, ("key  value", multiplier).
      - The "key" specifies the job field to look up, which will be checked for a match with "value".
      - If a job matches multiple rules, the first match is used.
      - Subordinates will never be matched except by an exact 'id' match, to avoid accidental job multiplication (eg. XL ship with a wing of L ships which have wings of M ships which have wings of S ships).
      - Supported keys:
        - 'id'      : Name of the job entry; supports wildcards for non-wings.
        - 'faction' : The name of the faction.
        - 'tags'    : One or more tags, space separated.
        - 'size'    : The ship size suffix, 'xs','s','m','l', or 'xl'.
        - '*'       : Matches all non-wing jobs; takes no value term.
    
    Examples:
    
        Adjust_Job_Count(1.2)
        Adjust_Job_Count(
            ('id       masstraffic*'      , 0.5),

Rescale Transforms:

  * Common documentation

    Ship transforms will commonly use a group of matching rules to determine which ships get modified, and by how much.   
    
    * Matching rules:
      - These are tuples pairing a matching rule (string) with transform defined args, eg. ("key  value", arg0, arg1, ...).
      - The "key" specifies the xml field to look up, which will be checked for a match with "value".

  * Adjust_Ship_Cargo_Capacity

    Adjusts the cargo capacities of matching ships.  If multiple ships use the same storage macro, it is modified by an average of the ship multipliers.
        
    Args are one or more dictionaries with these fields, where matching rules are applied in order, with a ship being grouped by the first rule it matches:
    
    * multiplier
      - Float, how much to multiply current cargo capacity by.
    * match_any
      - List of matching rules. Any ship matching any of these is included, if not part of match_none.
    * match_all
      - List of matching rules. Any ship matching all of these is included, if not part of match_none.
    * match_none
      - List of matching rules. Any ship matching any of these is excluded.

      - Can be used in early matching rules to remove ships from all later matching rules.
            
    Example:
    ```
    Adjust_Ship_Cargo_Capacity(
        {'match_all' : ['purpose mine'],  'multiplier' : 2,},
        {'match_all' : ['purpose trade'], 'multiplier' : 1.5},
        )
    ```
        

  * Rescale_Ship_Speeds

    Rescales the speeds of different ship classes, centering on the give target average speeds. Ships are assumed to be using their fastest race engines. Averaged across all ships of the rule match.
    
    Cargo capacity of traders and miners is adjusted to compensate for speed changes, so they move a similar amount of wares. If multiple ships use the same cargo macro, it is adjusted by an average of their speed adjustments.
        
    Args are one or more dictionaries with these fields, where matching rules are applied in order, with a ship being grouped by the first rule it matches:
    
    * average
      - Float, the new average speed to adjust to.
      - If None, keeps the original average.
    * variation
      - Float, less than 1, how much ship speeds are allowed to differ from the average relative to the average.
      - If None, keeps the original variation.
      - If original variation is less than this, it will not be changed.
      - Only applies strictly to 90% of ships; up to 10% are treated as outliers, and will have their speed scaled similarly but will be outside this band.
      - Eg. 0.5 means 90% of ships will be within +/- 50% of their group average speed.
    * match_any
      - List of matching rules. Any ship matching any of these is included, if not part of match_none.
    * match_all
      - List of matching rules. Any ship matching all of these is included, if not part of match_none.
    * match_none
      - List of matching rules. Any ship matching any of these is excluded.
    * use_arg_engine
      - Bool, if True then Argon engines will be assumed for all ships instead of their faction engines.
    * use_split_engine
      - Bool, if True then Split engines will be assumed.
      - This will tend to give high estimates for ship speeds, eg. mk4 engines.
    * skip
      - Optional, bool, if True then this group is not edited.
      - Can be used in early matching rules to remove ships from all later matching rules.
            
    Example:
    ```
    Rescale_Ship_Speeds(
        {'match_any' : ['name ship_spl_xl_battleship_01_a_macro'], 'skip' : True},
        {'match_all' : ['type  scout' ],  'average' : 500, 'variation' : 0.2},
        {'match_all' : ['class ship_s'],  'average' : 400, 'variation' : 0.5},
        {'match_all' : ['class ship_m'],  'average' : 300, 'variation' : 0.5},
        {'match_all' : ['class ship_l'],  'average' : 200, 'variation' : 0.5},

    Args are one or more dictionaries with these fields, where matching rules are applied in order, with a weapon being grouped by the first rule it matches. If a bullet or missile is used by multiple weapons in different match groups, their adjustments will be averaged.
    
    A dictionary has the following shared fields:
    
    * match_any, match_all, match_none
      - Lists of matching rules. Weapon is selected if matching nothing from match_none, and anything from match_any or everything from match_all.
    * skip
      - Optional, bool, if True then this group is not edited.
      - Can be used as a way to blacklist weapons.
          
    Matching rules are strings with the following format:
    * The "key" specifies the xml field to look up, which will be checked for a match with "value".
    * Supported keys for weapons:

  * Adjust_Weapon_Fire_Rate

    Adjusts weapon rate of fire. DPS and heat/sec remain constant. Time between shots in a burst and time between bursts are affected equally for burst weapons.  If multiple matched weapons use the same bullet or missile, the modifier will be averaged between them.
            
    Args are one or more dictionaries with these fields, where matching rules are applied in order, with a ship being grouped by the first rule it matches:
    
    * multiplier
      - Float, amount to multiply fire rate by.

Utilities:

  * Cat_Pack

    Packs all files in subdirectories of the given directory into a new catalog file.  Only subdirectories matching those used in the X4 file system are considered.
    
    * source_dir_path
      - Path to the directory holding subdirectories to pack.
      - Subdirectories are expected to match typical X4 folder names, eg. 'aiscripts','md', etc.
    * dest_cat_path
      - Path and name for the catalog file being generated.
      - Prefix the cat file name with 'ext_' when patching game files, or 'subst_' when overwriting game files.
    * include_pattern
      - String or list of strings, optional, wildcard patterns for file names to include in the unpacked output.
      - Eg. "*.xml" to unpack only xml files, "md/*" to  unpack only mission director files, etc.
      - Case is ignored.
    * exclude_pattern
      - String or list of strings, optional, wildcard patterns for file names to include in the unpacked output.
      - Eg. "['*.lua','*.dae']" to skip lua and dae files.
    * generate_sigs
      - Bool, if True then dummy signature files will be created.
    * separate_sigs
      - Bool, if True then any signatures will be moved to a second cat/dat pair suffixed with .sig.
        

  * Cat_Unpack

    Unpack a single catalog file, or a group if a folder given. When a file is in multiple catalogs, the latest one in the list will be used. If a file is already present at the destination, it is compared to the catalog version and skipped if the same.
    
    * source_cat_path
      - Path to the catalog file, or to a folder.
      - When a folder given, catalogs are read in X4 priority order according to its expected names.
    * dest_dir_path
      - Path to the folder where unpacked files are written.
    * include_pattern
      - String or list of strings, optional, wildcard patterns for file names to include in the unpacked output.
      - Eg. "*.xml" to unpack only xml files
      - Case is ignored.
    * exclude_pattern
      - String or list of strings, optional, wildcard patterns for file names to include in the unpacked output.
      - Eg. "['*.lua']" to skip lua files.
    * allow_md5_errors
      - Bool, if True then files with md5 errors will be unpacked, otherwise they are skipped.
      - Such errors may arise from poorly constructed catalog files.
        

  * Check_All_Extensions

    Calls Check_Extension on all enabled extensions, looking for errors. Returns True if no errors found, else False.
        

  * Check_Extension

    Checks an extension for xml diff patch errors and dependency errors. Problems are printed to the console. Returns True if no errors found, else False.
    
    Performs up to three passes that adjust extension loading order: in alphabetical folder order, as early as possible (after its dependencies), and as late as possible (after all other extensions that can go before it).
    
    * extension_name
      - Name (folder) of the extension being checked.
      - May be given in original or lower case.
      - This should match an enabled extension name findable on the normal search paths set in Settings.
    * check_other_orderings
      - Bool, if True then the 'earliest' and 'latest' loading orders will be checked, else only 'alphabetical' is checked.
      - These are recommended to identify where dependencies should be added to extensions, to protect against other extensions changing their folder name and thereby their loading order.
      - Defaults to False, to avoid printing errors that won't be present with the current extension order.
    * return_log_messages
      - Bool, if True then instead of the normal True/False return, this will instead return a list of logged lines that contain any error messages.
      - Does not stop the normal message Prints.
        

  * Generate_Diff

    Generate a diff of changes between two xml files, creating a diff patch.
    
    * original_file_path
      - Path to the original xml files that act as the baseline.
    * modified_file_path
      - Path to the modified versions of the xml files.
    * output_file_path
      - Path to write the diff patches to.
    * skip_unchanged
      - Bool, skip output for files that are unchanged (removing any existing diff patch).
      - Default will generate empty diff patches.
    * verbose
      - Bool, print the path of the outputs on succesful writes.
        

  * Generate_Diffs

    Generate diffs for changes between two xml containing folders, creating diff patches.
    
    * original_dir_path
      - Path to the original xml file that acts as the baseline.
    * modified_dir_path
      - Path to the modified version of the xml file.
    * output_dir_path
      - Path to write the diff patch to.
    * skip_unchanged
      - Bool, skip output for files that are unchanged (removing any existing diff patch).
      - Default will generate empty diff patches.
    * verbose
      - Bool, print the path of the outputs on succesful writes.
        

  * Write_Modified_Binaries

    Write out any modified binaries.  These are placed in the main x4 folder, not in an extension.
        

  * Write_To_Extension

    Write all currently modified game files to the extension folder. Existing files at the location written on a prior call will be cleared out. Content.xml will have dependencies added for files modified from existing extensions.
    
    * skip_content
      - Bool, if True then the content.xml file will not be written.
      - Content is automatically skipped if Make_Extension_Content_XML was already called.
