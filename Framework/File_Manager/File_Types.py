class Game_File:
    '''
    Base class to represent a source file.
    This may be read from the source folder or a cat/dat pair.
    In either case, this will capture some properties of the file
    for organization purposes.

    Attributes:
    * name
      - String, name of the file, without pathing.
      - Automatically parsed from virtual_path.
    * virtual_path
      - String, the path to the file in the game's virtual file system,
        using forward slash separators, including name.
      - This is the same as used in transform requirements and loads.
    * suffix
      - The name suffix, with dot, eg. ".xml", or None if no suffix found.
    * file_source_path
      - String, sys path where the file's original contents were read from,
        either a loose file or a cat file.
      - None for generated files.
    * is_substitution
      - Bool, if True then this file came from a "subst_##.cat" style of
        catalog file, and is meant to replace any file that came before
        it.
      - False for core game files or other extension files.
    * modified
      - Bool, if True then this file should be treated as modified,
        to be written out.
      - Files only read should leave this flag False.
      - Pending development; defaults False for now.
    * from_source
      - Bool, if True then this file originates from some source
        on disk (cat, loose, etc.).
      - If False (default), this is is generated by the customizer.
      - Has some impact on write format, eg. xml diff patching.
      - If loading a file from disk but wanting to overwrite it during
        writeback, leave this as False.
    * edit_in_place
      - Bool, if True then this file originates from some loose file source
        and is being edited, where the original will be overwritten.
      - Intended just for use with an existing content.xml in the output
        extension folder.
      - Such files will not be recorded in the customizer log of
        written files.
    * extension_name
      - String, optional, name of the extension this file was read
        from.
    * source_extension_names
      - List of strings, the names of the extensions that contributed
        to this file's contents, either directly or through patching.
      - Will always include extension_name if given.
      - Empty if this is just a vanilla file.
    * written
      - Bool, if this file has had its changes written back out.
      - Used selectively by the file writeback system.
    * load_error
      - Bool, True if this file experienced a load error.
      - Generally, error files should be skipped.
      - Primarily used for empty xml files.
