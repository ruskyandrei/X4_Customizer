    Prints out speeds of various ships, under given engine assumptions,
    to the plugin log.

    * use_arg_engine
      - Bool, if True then Argon engines will be assumed for all ships
        instead of their faction engines.
    * use_split_engine
      - Bool, if True then Split engines will be assumed.
      - This will tend to give high estimates for ship speeds, eg. mk4 engines.

    '''
    Note:
    Vanilla ship speeds have these approximate averages (race engines):
    xs: 130 (58 to 152)
    s : 328 (71 to 612)
    m : 319 (75 to 998)
    l : 146 (46 to 417)
    xl: 102 (55 to 164)

    Split ships exaggerate the high end, eg. alligator(gas) hitting 998.
    The xs includes boarding pods (29 speed), drones, mass traffic.
