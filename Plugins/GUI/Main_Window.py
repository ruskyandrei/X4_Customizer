Top level of the GUI.

Notes:
- Layout made with Qt designer.
- Widgets organized using custom classes.
    In Designer, promote a widget to the custom name, and give
    the import path as Framework.GUI.<module name>, since relative
    paths don't work out however the ui file is being loaded,
    and this direct import will work since the sys path is setup
    already.

    Scrapped: signals like this get messy: if 'loaded' and 'modified'
    are emitted (from a tab that did both), listeners will often do
    a double-refresh (wasteful). Alternatives are to combine signals
    into one macro signal with a series of flags (kinda clumsy), or
    to skip signals entirely and just do function calls to the main
    window (as done before thinking of signals).
    The function calls also allow prioritizing the viewed tab
    for updates, and are no more (maybe less) complicated to manage,
    so signals are skipped in favor of functions.

    Signals (emitted from child tabs, which may emit multiple):
    * sig_file_system_reset
      - Emitted when the File_System is reset completely, as well
        as once at startup to init all tabs.
      - Tabs should generally do a full refresh if they present
        data from the file system.
    * sig_files_modified
      - Emitted when a tab performed some function that may modify
        files in the file system.
      - Tabs should do a soft refresh if they present modified data from
        the file system.
    * sig_files_loaded
      - Emitted when a tab performed a game file loading, but did not
        do modification.
      - Tabs only need to reset if they are conditioned on which
        files are loaded, eg. the VFS.
